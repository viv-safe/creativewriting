Brown bear, burly bear
Love that grin, your husky trim. 
What's that limp? 
Why do you squint? 
Stay safe, brown bear -
Within your line.
Let no one swear
To steal your shine.


***

Dear child, one day 
When the sky was gray,
I heard a woman talk
To a she-bear on her walk.

The bold woman was Mrs. Lee-Selby
She was clever as can be 
She was patient and persuasive
And a little apprehensive 
Mrs. Lee-Selby did not scold her
(Brown she-bears can be fiercer)

Mrs. Lee-Selby is a teacher 
So her message was very sure
The wild she-bear heard her clearly
And said ‘thank you,’ very humbly.

The she-bear was a city bear
She was homeless for a tree or cave.
No woods were left for her to share
And no other wildlife would behave.

These city bears can be silly bears
Eating prickly pears
And sprayed tomatoes
Wandering about on their tippy toes 
Getting grumbly growly 
Tummy tunes.
In twirly whirly
Dusty fumes.

Sleeping on county park tables 
Playing on the city see saw
Bathing in my swimming pool
Sleeping on Grandpa's green lawn chair
Visiting whiney horses’ stables
Eating pizza, slurping from a straw
Rifling through trash as I watch them drool
While daddy's hopping madly in the air!

Skip the beer and soda pop.
Avoid the trash with processed treats!
“Uh oh, here comes Ranger Cop.”
It's time to run, through the park’s BBQ seats.

Oh my, dear bears, stay away from harm
Though human chairs seem full of charm. 
Don't find me, bear - Don't limp no more
I have no kit to fix your limp.

Brown bear, dear bear 
I really do care.
Our Woods are now
no more just woods
Watch those traps
And stealthy rifles
Cranes, cargo, flaps
Locks, rocks and cables 
There's now new structures
With technical SOWs

Your woods are now 
no more just woods
With smart know-how
In our natural foods 
New baby bears
Must now be scarce
Grown bears must dance 
to brand new rhymes.
In human routes
Beyond Old Woods.

The world’s anew
Don't eat from trash
Drink from fresh dew, 
Find nuts to stash.

Good news, dear bear -
The bees are back, for you and me.
Watch them sip water from my garden fairy,
And giggle as they suckle from our native flowers.
These busy bees are clever makers -
Of honey and berries, nuts, grass and more!

***

Be well, brown bear
Climb, roll, swim, run 
Forage as you dare
Enjoy the sun. 

Brown baby bear,
In spring’s fresh breeze -
On earth’s moist soil -
I see you prance
At the earth’s first show.
These pretty flowers, 
And bright green grass,
Make magnificent meals for skinny bears!

The summer’s come, it's time to play!
When will you dine?
What will you find?
Fancy flowers, meaty mushrooms
Busy ants and wriggly worms?

Climb trees, brown bear
Claw ants and bugs -
Catch quick brown squirrels everywhere.
Cross the brook
Chase runny waters
Catch sockeye salmon 
From angry anglers.

Brown bear, burly bear 
The summer’s gone -
I guess you’re big now
Where’s your den? (I cannot tell)
Are you in that three foot hollow tree?
Are you under that tree root canopy?
Are you in a cave that is rocky?
Do you also live in a house like me?

It's winter now, it's cold and dark
I saw you sleeping in your lair, 
You, mama, papa, and baby bear
And dreaming through the season’s lark.

Dear children, mummies, daddies, and nannies -
You may one day see a bear.
They might be white, black, brown or grizzly;
Don't pat or hug them, pretty please.
Don't feed them cookies - don't take no selfies,
Call Wildlife Conservation Care A.S.A.P.
